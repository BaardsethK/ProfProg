## Group Discussion
### Language(s) we used
I mainly used C# when programming for the project, but GO was also used for the server. I will not discuss GO, as I have no prior experience with it.
In general, using C# has been a positive experience. The fact that Visual Studio is designed for it (in part) is very helpful at times, because it enables us to utilize the IDE better, and when there is issues, there are often documented ways of solving or troubleshooting them.

Since Unity3D currently only uses C#, finding solutions for Unity with this language is usually very easy (depending on the issue). There are already a lot of forum threads and guides, so less time needs to be spent on "figuring it out".

In addition, the fact that C# is call-by-reference, as well as very type safe is "comforting" to know when programming. For me, it makes it easier to plan and predict code behaviour when programming.

The biggest drawback with C# is the compiler optimization, which can make debugging and troubleshooting harder. When sequencial operations are required, this has to be taken into consideration, which is an annoying factor.

### Code Review

## Individual Discussion
### Good code
For review of good code, I have decided to review EyegazeGeneralPointer.cs.



### Bad code
For review of bad code, I have decided to review

### Refactoring
I have decided to refactor ... as I feel that the overall quality can be higher.

## Reflection

### Overall
Personally, I feel like professionalism in programming refers to developing and documenting code so it is easily possible for anyone to continue working on it. This way, leaving a project does not burden those who have to continue the work on it. In addition, discussion and refactoring should be a part of this, when possible. This can help create a more homogenous coding/commenting standard across a team, and can make the code easier to understand for someone else.

I feel like it can be summed up in "being able to give your code to someone else without instruction" because this means that your code isn't too hard to learn. The quality of the code is good enough to be understood, the documentation is able to explain it well enough, and the functions "makes sense", even if refactoring can help.

### Code quality
I feel like writing code of as "decent" quality is a requirement for being a professional. For me, this means self explanatory variable names, using the same conventions over a whole program, and a reasonable architecture (however, everything can be justified as "reasonable architecture" to some degree).

### Documentation
Most code should have some documentation, outside of code comments. Most people won't remember everything they did, and the documentation can provide better insight into the architecture/structure. If someone else is take over the project, the documentation can help them understand the structure and code faster, and cut down the time spent learning how the program is stru-ctured and functions.

### Professional Behaviour
Professional behaviour should be a part of professionalism. By this, I mean the ability to act decently towards other programmers, especially if someone new is introduced to a project, or is taking over an old project. It is likely to happen that you will meet someone who knows either more or less than you, that is introduced to a project. 

If they're new, they might ask "dumb" questions because to you, the functionality is obvious. I think it's important to keep in mind that people can have different experience and knowledge from yourself, and that them understanding your way of thinking (and programming) is not a given. 

If they're more experienced, it can be important to be more humble and open about the quality of your own code and documentation. A more experienced programmer might criticize or comment on the code you have written. Being able to take this as an opportunity to improve your own skills, and to reflect on the statements rather than deflect them. It can happen that the programmer can say degrading statements as well, and this is something you can't necessarily change. However, it is something that can be handled in a professional manner.
